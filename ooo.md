## Applying OOP and design pattern to a software sadly might be harm and costly, for avoiding of this bad events you need observe some principles that named SOLID principles
</center>
<br>
<br>

### This principles are :

```css
S -> /* Single Responsibility principle */
O -> /* Open/Close principle */
L -> /* Liskov substitution principle */
I -> /* Interface Segregation principle */
D -> /* Dependency Inversion principle */
```

### What is <b class="bg g">S</b> :
```css
Desciption :  /* S says the class must have a reason to change or have a responsibility for the software functionality . */

Goal       :  /* The main goal of this principle is Reducing complexity of class codes */
```
### What is <b class="bg g">O</b> :
```css
Desciption :  /* O say that a class should be open for extension but close for modification. */

Goal       :  /* The main idea of this principle is to keep existing code from breaking when you implement new features. (Like final keyword in software languages) */
```
### What is <b class="bg g">L</b> :
```css
Desciption :  /* 
                 When extending a class, remember that you should be able to 
                 pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent
                 class without breaking the client code. 
                 --------------------------------------------------------------
                 The substitution principle is a set of checks that are:

                 - Parameter types in a method of a subclass should match or be more abstract than parameter types in the method of the superclass.
                 - The return type in a method of a subclass should match or be a subtype of the return type in the method of the superclass.
                 - A method in a subclass shouldn‚Äôt throw types of exceptions which the base method isn‚Äôt expected to throw.
                 - A subclass shouldn‚Äôt strengthen pre-conditions.
                 - A subclass shouldn‚Äôt weaken post-conditions.
                 - A subclass shouldn‚Äôt change values of private fields of the superclass.
              */

Goal       :  /* Keep existing code from breaking when you implement new feature */
```
### What is <b class="bg g">I</b> :
```css
Desciption :  /* L say that clients shouldn‚Äôt be forced to depend on methods they do not use. */

Goal       :  /* According to the interface segregation principle, you should break down ‚Äúfat‚Äù interfaces into more granular and specific ones. */
```

### What is <b class="bg g">D</b> :
```css
Desciption :  /* D say that High-level classes shouldn‚Äôt depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn‚Äôt depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. */

Goal       :  /* 
                [Low-level classes] implement basic operations such as working
                with a disk, transferring data over a network, connecting to a
                database, etc.
                [Low-level classes] implement basic operations such as working
                with a disk, transferring data over a network, connecting to a
                database, etc.
            */
```
